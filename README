This program is Case Study 3 of the Target interview process which I have chosen to do.
In this program I was to create 3 methods to search 3 txt files and count the occurences of 
a given word or phrase. 

NOTES: 
	- all are case sensative
	- Method 3 compares sections of words as well ex. with input: the and text: they it will match
	  and add +1

METHOD 1:
	A simple alg that will move character by character until it finds a match of the 
	first charcater of the given word. If there is a match it will enter a loop in order 
	to determine if that list ends in a match. If not it will break. 

METHOD 2:
	Using regular expressions (more specifically fscanf) the program will look for strings 
	of length 10 followed by a space and match that to the given word. 

METHOD 3: 
	Uses the Bad Character Heuristic Boyer Moore Alg to preproccess the input and skip if possible some
	of the comparisons. (I did have to look this up I left links in the corresponding methods). 

TEST:
	The test for each generates 2M random strings of lengths 1 through 10 and runs them across all 
	3 methods sequentialy. 

RUN:
	To run the program type 
		make 
		make run 
	Then follow the prompts 

	To test type
		make 
		make runTest
